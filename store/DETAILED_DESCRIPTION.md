TerraFlow for Terrain

TerraFlow improves the Terrain web app's calendar experience by adding an enhanced agenda, faster event creation, richer event details, and direct integration with Terrain's events and members APIs.

Key features
- Clickable agenda table with location, organiser and description.
- Faster event creation and sensible defaults (start time, duration, calendar, location).
- Month-based agenda navigation and greying out of past events.
- Confirmations for marking events concluded; prevents illegal reopen attempts.
- Integration with Terrain APIs to fetch, create, update and delete events (uses the user's existing Terrain session).

Permissions & privacy
- TerraFlow injects packaged scripts into pages on `terrain.scouts.com.au` to render the UI enhancements.
- The extension makes API calls to `events.terrain.scouts.com.au` and `members.terrain.scouts.com.au` only when the user interacts with TerraFlow (viewing, creating, or editing events).
- No remote code execution; no telemetry is collected. Privacy policy: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkmatt/TerraFlow/main/PRIVACY.md
