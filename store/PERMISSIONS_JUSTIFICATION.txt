Permissions justification for Chrome Web Store review

Permissions requested:
- host_permissions: https://terrain.scouts.com.au/*, https://events.terrain.scouts.com.au/*, https://members.terrain.scouts.com.au/*

Why these are needed:
- The extension augments the Terrain web application in-page via a content script (`/scripts/terraflowloader.js`) which loads packaged scripts/styles. This is performed using the `content_scripts` entry in the manifest (no runtime `scripting` API is used).
- The extension fetches and modifies event and member data by calling Terrain's REST APIs. Those calls are performed only in response to explicit user actions in TerraFlow and use the user's existing Terrain session for authentication.

Privacy/security assurances:
- TerraFlow does not execute code fetched from remote hosts; all injected scripts are packaged with the extension and delivered inside the extension bundle.
- No analytics, telemetry, or off-device storage of user data is performed by the extension.
- Local settings are saved only to browser `localStorage` under keys prefixed with `terraflow_event_`.
